.SH OVERVIEW
Upon execution, the script presents a main menu with three options: 'Manual backup', 'Automatic Backup', and 'Restore'.
The user can select an option using Zenity dialog boxes.

If the user chooses 'Manual backup', the script prompts the user to select either a single file or a folder for backup.
After the selection is made, the script gives an option to compress the backup into a .zip file.
If selected, the script generates a unique backup name based on the current date and time and compresses the selected file or
folder into a .zip file. If compression is not selected, the script creates a copy of the selected file or folder with a
modified name. The backup is then saved in the specified backup path.

If the user chooses 'Automatic Backup', the script provides four options: 'Specific date', 'Daily', 'Weekly' and 'Monthly'.
Depending on the chosen option, the script prompts the user to select backup parameters such as backup time, day, and month.
The script creates a cron job based on the selected parameters to schedule automatic backups.

If the user selects 'Restore', the script presents two options: 'Restore a file or .zip' and 'Restore a folder'.
The user can choose to restore a specific file or a folder from a backup. The script prompts the user to select the backup file or
folder and the destination folder for restoration. If the selected backup is a .zip file, it is extracted to the specified
destination folder. Otherwise, the selected file or folder is copied to the destination folder.

.SH EXAMPLES
Say you want to set an automatic backup that would create copies of your university-related files, saved in UNISTUFF folder, every day at some specific time, i.e. 10:00 AM. 
.PP
To do that, go to 'Automatic Backup' in main menu, choose 'Daily', type time HH:MM, where HH is an hour, MM - minutes, and then click 'OK'.
.PP
Choose 'FOLDER' and then browse your file system to find your UNISTUFF folder and click 'OK'. You'll receive a communication message showing the path to your folder. 
.PP
Then, you will be asked if you want to compress your backups or not. Say we do, click 'Yes' - then browse you file system to choose a place for your copies and click 'OK'. You will be informed again by showing the path you just chose.
.PP
That's it! You've just set an automatic backuping!

The process is similar with other options available in this script - just follow the program: it will tell you what to do :)
